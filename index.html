    <p>The Milky Way[c] is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars  that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,600 light-years),[10]  but only about 1,000 light-years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge). Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years (613 kpc).[26][27] The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which  is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.[28][29] It is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars[30][31] and at least that number of planets.[32][33] The Solar System is located  at a radius of about 27,000 light-years (8.3 kpc) from the Galactic Center,[34] on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form  a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The Galactic Center is an intense radio source known as Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole of 4.100 (± 0.034) million solar masses.[35][36] The oldest stars  in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.[37] Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[38] Following the  1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis,[39] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.</p>
